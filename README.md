# lxl-nn - A simple Neural Network architecture

A feedforward-backpropagation neural network model was used with small modifications.
Multiple hidden layers are supported.

#Info
Network definition: { Input Layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer }
#####Example: {6,12,6} or {3,5,5,3} etc.

#Testing
The MNIST database was used for testing the algorithm. 
More information about MNIST database and recent files can be obtained from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Usage
Use CMAKE for compiling, unzip the Data.zip file for the required training and testing data.
